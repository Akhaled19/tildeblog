  *Today I Learned - de blog*

This is a learn-to-use-django project for the Python Study Central discord at https://discord.com/invite/6pVFMUEKxX

Goal is to create a blog specialiazed for capturing "Today I Learned" topics.  Main intent is to create a:
	- "look what I can do" artifact to show an employer, 
	- "look what I did"  to show your manager at review time
	- "stash" technical items you've learned about so you can remind yourself

 - single author (not a group blog)
 - installable django app
 - article tagging
 - flexsearch with live update results (via htmx/alpine.js)
 - has draft queue
 - supports comments and has some spam filter/are you a human challenge
 - quick capture of "seed" from mobile / from discord channel.  So you can remind yourself to write up something you learn

 
Possible: create a "blog ring" of others using the app, with an engine that discovers collections that seem to
touch on similar topics as yours.  With the idea being you might be interested in "Today I Learned" stuff from people who've
thought it worth mentioning certain things.  This would be most useful if there were a protocol not married to django, as
presumably many people who don't want to run their own django server also learn worthwhile things.
